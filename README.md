# Object-Oriented Programming in Java - Course Exercises

This repository contains my exercises from the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java** course, taught by **Gustavo Guanabara**. The course is available on Curso em Vídeo.

## About the Course

The course offers a guide to OOP concepts using Java, covering fundamental topics such as:

- **Classes & Objects**: Understanding the building blocks of OOP.
- **Instantiation**: Bringing objects to life from classes.
- **Abstraction & Encapsulation**: Managing complexity by hiding details and exposing only necessary parts.
- **Inheritance**: Leveraging existing code for new classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Interacting with objects through a common interface while allowing for different underlying forms.

## Exercises

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific lesson from the course. Inside, you'll find Java files with my implementations.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank Professor Gustavo Guanabara and the team at Curso em Vídeo for providing this amazing course for learning Java and OOP concepts.
